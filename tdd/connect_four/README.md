# README.MD for Connect Four

There are a few things that we can extrapolate from the TDD code of Tic_tac_toe and integrate with a connect four app.

  * We can extend the board from 3 x 3 to 6 x 7. 
  * Instead of allowing the user to place on any spot on the board we would have to use only columns to place our marker
  * When you choose a column the marker will be placed at the lowest available space. 
  * Winner must connect four markers in a row, a column, or diagonal
  * We can keep the rotating player method that we had used in the ttt game
