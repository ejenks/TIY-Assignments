== README

Planning for moving from weekend to here:

* todo.rb => app/models
* todo_controller.rb => app/controllers
  * except for the URLs, which go to config/routes.rb
* setup.rb => done by a migration
* index.html.erb => app/views/todos/index.html.erb
* app.js and index.css => ??

* I can do both the todo.rb and the db migration at the same time
